# â‰ˆ35% PROCESS FOR FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE, MANY THINGS UNFINISHED

This is the English version of the README. For the Chinese version, click [here](./README.zh.md).

A toolkit for the anime game Honkai: Star Rail

You need to download ALL files, or download executable in [Releases](https://github.com/Bugstudios/srtool/releases) to make sure you have everything collected.

## IF YOU ARE RUNNING WITH THE .pyw FILE:
  1. Please make sure you have every assets collected.
  2. You need a python environment.
  3. Make sure you run the
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     In order to install every dependencies for this python script.
     
## IF YOU ARE RUNNING WITH THE EXECUTABLE FILE:
  1. Make sure it is the latest release.
  2. The executable files are not stable, I strongly recommend you use the .pyw version instead of .exe version. I am not going to answer any questions about the bugs appear in the executable file.
  3. The executeable file will only be released if I finish a public version. There is no beta version of executable file.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
  1. This program is designed for Windows OS, some of the expansions or features cannot work in other OS, install container to solve this.
  2. This program is designed for Chinese speakers, I probably make english version some day, but until now, the language is written in the code, not a language file.
  3. YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE IF THE GAME RELEASE IT'S NEW VERSION!!
