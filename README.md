# SRTOOL by zhx201933
A toolkit for the anime game Honkai: Star Rail

You need to download ALL files, or download executable in [Releases](https://github.com/Bugstudios/srtool/releases) to make sure you have everything collected.

## IF YOU ARE RUNNING WITH THE .pyw FILE:
  1. Please make sure you have every assets collected.
  2. You need a python environment.
  3. Make sure you run the
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     In order to install every dependencies for this python script.
     
## IF YOU ARE RUNNING WITH THE EXECUTABLE FILE:
  1. Make sure it is the latest release.
  2. The executable files are not stable, I strongly recommend you use the .pyw version instead of .exe verser. I am not going to answer any questions about the bugs appear in the executable file.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
  1. This program is designed for Windows OS, I am not going to support Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android or something else.
  2. YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE IF THE GAME RELEASE IT'S NEW VERSION!!
