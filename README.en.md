**SRTOOL**: A toolkit for the anime game Honkai: Star Rail

You need to download ALL files, or download executable in [Releases](https://github.com/Bugstudios/srtool/releases) to make sure you have everything collected.

## Running with the .pyw file:
  1. Please make sure you have every assets collected.
  2. You need a python environment.
  3. Make sure you run the
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     In order to install every dependencies for this python script.
     
## Running with the executable file:
  1. Make sure it is the latest release.
  2. The executable files are not stable, I strongly recommend you use the .pyw version instead of .exe version. I am not going to answer any questions about the bugs appear in the executable file.
  3. The executeable file will only be released if I finish a public version. There is no beta version of executable file.
  4. Executable files are only for Windows, as for other OS, install container to solve this.

# Notes
  1. This program is designed for Windows OS, some of the expansions or features cannot work in other OS, install container to solve this.
  2. This program is designed for Chinese speakers, I probably make english version some day, but until now, the language is written in the code, not a language file.
  3. Update this software if the game released its new version!
